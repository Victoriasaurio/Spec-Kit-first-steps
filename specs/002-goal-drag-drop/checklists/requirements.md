# Specification Quality Checklist: Goal Drag-and-Drop Reordering

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: February 5, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All user stories have clear priorities and independent test criteria
- Functional requirements are specific and testable without implementation details
- Success criteria include measurable metrics across performance, reliability, accessibility, and user experience
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults for MVP scope and concurrent edit handling
